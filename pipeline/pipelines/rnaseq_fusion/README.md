RNAFusion Pipeline
==================
The Gene Fusion pipeline identifies gene fusion events using RNA-seq FASTQ files.  
    
Four separate tools detect fusion events: 
[deFuse](https://sourceforge.net/p/defuse/wiki/DeFuse/), 
[FusionMap](http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=FusionMap), 
[EricScript](https://sites.google.com/site/bioericscript/home), 
and [INTEGRATE](https://sourceforge.net/p/integrate-fusion/wiki/Home/).

Tophat2 is used to generate precursor files for the INTEGRATE fusion detection tool.

The fusion detection results are combined into one common file (.cff) that gives information about gene fusions including gene names, 
type of fusion (ex. read through vs. gene fusion), and the tools that identified each fusion event. 
Additionally, if DNA sequencing information is available for the samples of interest, 
the Gene Fusion Pipeline can check for DNA support of gene fusions detected from RNA. 

The RNAseq pipeline requires a sampleinfo file to be provided, which is a tab-delimited document with each sample 
as a line with information about sample disease. The first column gives sample name, second column gives the disease name,
third column tells whether the sample comes from a tumor (TP) or normal (NT) tissue. Additional columns can give further 
information about samples.

In addition, a dnabam file must be provided, which gives the name of .bam file(s) associated with RNA-seq sample.
If there is no DNA sequencing associated with the sample, provide the name of an empty file


THIS SUMMARY SECTION IS NOT GENERATED BY THE FUSION PIPELINE. SHOULD A STEP BE ADDED?
Finally, a summary html report is automatically generated by the pipeline at the end of the analysis.
This report contains description
of the sequencing experiment as well as a detailed presentation of the pipeline steps and results.
Various Quality Control (QC) summary statistics are included in the report and additional QC analysis
is accessible for download directly through the report. The report includes also the main references
of the software tools and methods used during the analysis, together with the full list of parameters
that have been passed to the pipeline main script.

An example of the RNA-Seq report for an analysis on Public Corriel CEPH B-cell is available for illustration
purpose only: [RNA-Seq report](http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/tools/rnaReport/index.html).

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PIPELINE IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE. SHOULD THIS BE ADDED?

```
1- picard_sam_to_fastq
----------------------
Convert SAM/BAM files from the input readset file into FASTQ format
if FASTQ files are not already specified in the readset file. Do nothing otherwise.
rerwritten from common.Illumina.picard_sam_to_fastq, make directory for this step under result folder in case the orginal bam file directory is not writtable

3- merge_fastq 
--------------
Merge paired end fastqs of the same sample

4- defuse
---------
Run Defuse to call gene fusions

5- fusionmap
